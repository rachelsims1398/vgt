 · Guest answered: There are several possibile reasons why a RTW cheat doesn't work. 1) The cheats wasn't typed perfectly. The cheats are case sensitive, the command name doesn't contain whitespace, I.e. The "_" underscore character doesn't stand for space, it must be entered literally for cheats like "add_money ".
