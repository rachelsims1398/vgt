You CAN but you won't be back into ketosis for a day or two, pizza breaks down SLOW and it will take a while to recover from it. You may also wake up with an awesome carb hangover. I wouldn't, but have at it. When I do push the limits I fast the next day, or at least until the next days dinner. First Cheat day: Breakfast: 4 hard boiled eggs Lunch: Firehouse Subs Meatball Sub with chips and pickle, unsweet tea Dinner: Homemade spinach chicken pizza, BBQ pulled pork pizza, cheese fries Dessert: Cake with buttercream icing and girl scout cookies. Really over did it on the first cheat day. Felt like crap after words. Cheat day, but had 3 slices of pizza and 3 beers. Feel super guilty, ah fuckkkk. 3 weeks feels like down the drain. Man, i know it's my cheat day but i could have been stronger. le sigh. 3 pieces of Pizza Hut Supreme medium pizza = cals ( x 3) 3 beers =~ cals ( x 3) Total for this meal = calories.
