MotorStorm Cheats. Don't think mud is dangerous? You haven't seen the way these off-road rides throw it around in this full-contact g: monument valley. Cheat mode. At the main menu, hold L1 + L2 + L3 + R1 + R2 + R3 + Left Analog-stick Down + Right Analog-stick Up to unlock all bonuses. If you entered the code correctly, you will hear a sound. Note: Enabling this cheat will disable any further progress in Missing: monument valley. This will most likely be my final work for MV! its been a blast!Missing: monument valley.
