Step 5: Love Yourself the Way You Are. After finding out your partner has cheated on you, you might start noticing all of your mistakes and faults more, even ones that aren't real. Suddenly you may feel that your hair is too curly, your hips too big, or your nose is too small.  · So, you cheated on your boyfriend and now you want him back.
