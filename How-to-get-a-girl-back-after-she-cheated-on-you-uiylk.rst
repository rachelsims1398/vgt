Answer her call right away, respond to her texts and emails as soon as possible and if she invites you somewhere; attend and be early. This is not the time to be playing games, you are very close to getting her back and this is the make-it or break-it time. She will feel a sense of independence and love for you if you attend to her every wish after cheating on her. This is the only way to . You need to let your girlfriend get out everything she needs to - whatever rage and anger she has is well warranted. Allow her to vent, and take everything she gives you short of a physical beating. If she goes that route, it's always time to leave. At the same time though, don't stick around too long. Tell your girlfriend you're sorry you cheated on her. Tell her you knew it was wrong, you're sorry for hurting her, and most of all you're sorry it destroyed the relationship. And when that's all said and done?
