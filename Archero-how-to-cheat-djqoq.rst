Can you cheat Archero? Luckily, this simple Archero cheat allows you to turn back time and try for a different boss (although it doesn’t work in boss-run chapters). When you encounter a boss that you don’t want to fight, force close the game. Then, open the game again and you will be back in the previous room. More new Archero Promo Codes are released once in a while or sometimes times(in a period of 2 to 3 months) by developers on the Archero FB page, Reddit, Discord, etc. If you don’t use these platforms, you can bookmark this page and check back . This little Archero hack has been fixed by the developer in the past, so there is a chance it won’t work forever. We’ll update this guide if anything changes.
